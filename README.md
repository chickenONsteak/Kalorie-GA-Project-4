## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Kalorie

Calorie tracking is one of the most effective ways to manage weight ‚Äî something I discovered after beginning my weightlifting journey. But like many others, I eventually gave it up after months of use because it felt tedious and time-consuming.

The vision behind **Kalorie** is to make tracking **quick, simple, and effortless** ‚Äî a process that takes **less than 5 minutes a day**. With this, anyone can stay consistent and in control of their health without the frustration of traditional tracking methods.

Kalorie is a calorie and nutrition tracking web application that helps users log meals, monitor daily intake, and build healthier eating habits. To achieve this speed and simplicity, the app leverages **AI-assisted tracking** instead of manual input:

- ü§ñ AI food recognition: Input meals with natural language (e.g., ‚Äú2 slices of pepperoni pizza and a Coke‚Äù) instead of manually entering every nutrient.
- üì∏ Image-based logging: Upload a meal photo and let the AI suggest possible foods and calorie counts.

Additionally, the app provides clear insights into calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates _(future expansion)_, making nutrition tracking both simple and intuitive.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Authentication:** User registration and login
- **Meal Logging:** Add, update, or delete meals with nutritional values
- **Dashboard:** Overview of daily and weekly calorie and macro intake
- **Calendar View:** Track meals and progress across days
- **Responsive Design:** Works across desktop and mobile

### Meal Logging

**Kalorie** makes meal logging quick and effortless with two options:

1. Describe your food (text input)
2. Upload a photo (image recognition)

**How it works**

1. Text description:
   1. Your input (e.g., ‚Äú2 slices of pepperoni pizza and a Coke‚Äù) is fitted into our scripted prompt
   2. The prompt is then sent to OpenAI's model, which returns:
      1. Name of food
      2. Calories
      3. Carbohydrates
      4. Protein
      5. Fats
      6. Assumptions made
      7. Confidence score
      8. Follow-up questions if the confidence score is low (to refine calorie & macro estimates)
1. Image upload:
   1. Your photo is analysed by an OpenAI vision model with our scripted prompt
   2. The output is then chained to the prompt above _(chain prompting)_ to produce the same structured results as text input
